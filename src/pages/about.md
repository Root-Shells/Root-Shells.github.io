Specializing in security assessments on enterprise and ICS systems. I've closely collaborated with IT, software teams, and SOCs. I've led penetration testing projects, translating technical findings into actionable steps for stakeholders. Committed to risk management, I've provided best practices for compliance and performed rigorous grey box assessments on third-party solutions to ensure their security before integration.

My expertise doesnâ€™t end with identifying vulnerabilities; it's about understanding the nuances of each challenge and tailoring solutions to fit. Beyond the codes and scripts, I believe in fostering collaboration, staying ahead of the curve, and always being prepared for the next big challenge in cybersecurity.

Away from the keyboard, my time off is all about hitting the right notes on the piano, keeping fit at the gym, enjoying a good session of Counter-Strike, and just hanging out with friends.
