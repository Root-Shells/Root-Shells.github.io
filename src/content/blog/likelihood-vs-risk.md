## Introduction

In the realm of penetration testing, accurately classifying the severity of vulnerabilities is crucial. It's not just about identifying the risks but also about articulating why a particular vulnerability is assigned a specific severity level. This understanding is key when communicating with clients, especially when explaining why similar vulnerabilities might have different risk classifications.

## Key Factors in Risk Classification

### Impact

- Data and System Compromise: What information or systems are at risk if the vulnerability is not addressed?
- CIA Triad Impact: How does the vulnerability affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability?
- Business Operations: Could the exploit disrupt the organization's ability to generate revenue?

### Likelihood

- Vulnerability Chain: How many vulnerabilities must be exploited to succeed?
- Access Requirements: What level of access is needed for exploitation?
- Victim Interaction: Does the exploit require the victim's actions?
- Attack Knowledge: Is the attack method well-known or obscure?
- Attacker Motivation: Would the target be lucrative enough for persistent attackers?

## Communication is Key

When presenting your findings, remember that your audience is the business, not just the technical team. Explaining the risks in a business context is essential for effective communication.

## Pentester's Perspective: Severity is Not Always Equal

Realize that not all critical findings are equal. The severity depends on both the level of access achievable upon successful exploitation and the engagement's agreed scope. For instance, a critical vulnerability in Active Directory could have far-reaching network consequences, whereas a critical issue in a web application might lead to database compromise. Both are significant within their contexts.

## Conclusion: The Art of Correct Severity Assignment

Successful risk classification in penetration testing hinges on a thorough understanding of both the likelihood and impact of each finding, aligned with the specific scope set by the client. As a pentester, mastering this nuanced approach is key to not only identifying vulnerabilities but also in effectively communicating their severity and potential business impact to clients.
