## Introduction

This blog post aims to guide individuals who are starting out in this field, offering practical steps to establish a successful penetration testing program within an organization.

## 1. Start Small and Demonstrate Real-World Risk

When you begin, it's crucial to focus on demonstrating real-world risks to the organization. Begin from the perspective of an insider threat, asking questions like "What if an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) was already inside?" Look into internal code repositories, file shares, CI/CD pipelines, and open services. Targeting these low-hanging fruits allows you to identify vulnerabilities without the need to bypass security controls. Itâ€™s often surprising how frequently a critical configuration file is left exposed on an open share.

## 2. Build Trust and Increase Risk Appetite

By starting with smaller, more manageable engagements, you build trust with senior leadership. Each successful engagement incrementally increases the organization's risk appetite and confidence in the OffSec program.

## 3. Plan Realistic Engagements for the First Year

Create a list of engagements based on the current threat landscape that can realistically be executed in the first year. Reference well-known breaches that have occurred and explain to leadership how these scenarios could impact your organization. This approach ensures that the exercises are not just theoretical but are grounded in real-world threats.

## 4. Map Known APT Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

Use frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to map out the TTPs of APT groups targeting your industry. Adapting these TTPs to fit your organization is a learning experience in itself. It helps in understanding how internal security controls function and in identifying network, OS, and infrastructure configuration weaknesses. This approach is particularly enlightening when developing droppers with post-exploitation in mind, from an external threat actor perspective.

## 5. Understand Your Security Controls

Compile a comprehensive list of all security controls deployed in your organization (e.g., EDR, AV, IDS, IPS, firewalls, email filters). Set up meetings with teams managing these systems to understand their configuration and operation. This knowledge is crucial when planning to bypass them in advanced malware engagements.

## 6. Document Your Techniques and Findings

Whenever you discover a new exploitation method, network pivot technique, or a way to bypass security controls, document it meticulously. These notes will become your playbook for future engagements, enhancing your strategy and approach.

## 7. Learn from Unsuccessful Engagements

Not every engagement will be successful. When you encounter failure, use it as a learning opportunity and a business case for further training. Understanding why certain approaches didn't work can be as informative as successful ones.

## 8. Spend Time on Understanding and Remediation

Deeply analyze your findings and focus on how they can be remedied. Remember, you're not just running a vulnerability scanner; your findings are often complex and require more than just a simple patch. Tie your remediation recommendations to internal security policies and governance. Avoid exaggerating risks or assuming poor configurations indicate a lack of technical savvy.

## Conclusion

Starting a penetration testing and offensive security program in a company is a gradual process that requires patience, strategy, and a deep understanding of the organization's infrastructure and security posture. By starting small, building trust, understanding your security environment, and continuously learning, you can establish a robust and effective OffSec program that significantly enhances your organization's security resilience.
